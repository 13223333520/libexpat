<p> This page describes some of the changes which should be expected
in Expat 3.  These are intended as notes made by the developers as
things get thought through; these can change at any time.  This is
<em>not</em> a projected feature list for Expat 3; to learn about the
target features, please read the <cite><a href="roadmap.html">Expat
Development Roadmap</a></cite>.  The changes described here are much
more focused on the details of Expat 3, and no attempt has been made
to balance the description of small changes with major new feature
development. </p>

<p> This list is not complete; we'll add to this as we think of things
and have time to write about them. </p>

<ul>
  <li> The signature of the <code>XML_ParserReset()</code> method will
  grow an additional argument allowing specification of what should be
  reset.  See <a href= "" >bug report 1109116: <em>Optimize
  implementation of XML_ParserReset</em></a> for more information. </li>

  <li> All structural event callback functions will return an
  <code>XML_Status</code> value that the parser will check.  This will
  allow an application to stop or suspend processing without having to
  use <code>setjmp()</code>/<code>longjmp()</code> hackery. </li>

  <li> The parser will support suspension of parsing to allow an
  application to pause parsing temporarily.  A new
  <code>XML_Status</code> value, <code>XML_STATUS_SUSPEND</code>, can
  be returned by the event callbacks to indicate that Expat should
  suspend parsing; the parser will then return from
  <code>XML_Parse()</code>, returning <code>XML_STATUS_SUSPEND</code>.
  Applications can resume parsing by calling
  <code>XML_ParseResume()</code>. </li>
</ul>
